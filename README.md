In this repo, I recall all the memory types and its performance, so you can figure out how your type of ddr/gddr ram succeed others.

Also, I read almost all NVIDIA white papers, and make a collection of its GPU architecture, and find a relationship among GPU/GPC/TPC/SM/CUDA, so you can figure out which GPU is the best deal.
